**5.2 and 5.3 (no issue)**

- First thing to note here is the value of AttributeSet at this point (if statement), it already has all its attributes set to the correct values (in both Server and Client).
- In these UE versions we require the initial broadcasts (for both Server and Client), without them the enemy health bar widget never receives any broadcast at the game start (so nothing happens).
- The widget receives exactly 2 broadcasts, one for Health and one for MaxHealth, both with the correct values (same behavior in Server and Client).

**5.4 (the issue appears here, 5.4.2 or earlier)**

- AttributeSet has all its attributes set to 0, but only in the Client.
- Now there are two automatic broadcasts at the game start (one for Health, one for MaxHealth; handled by the lambdas) but only in the Client, the one for the Health has the correct value (Data.NewValue) while the one for the MaxHealth has a value of 0 (here the issue).
- Extending from the previous point, now the initial broadcasts are only required for the Server, as it doesn't broadcasts automatically so you can modify your code accordingly (see image below). Note: If you do the initial broadcasts in the Client you are broadcasting zeros (see first point).

**5.5.0 Preview (the issue is fixed)**

- Same as 5.4 but now the automatic broadcast for MaxHealth has the correct value (instead of 0).
